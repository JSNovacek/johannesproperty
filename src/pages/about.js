        answering the following: How can our team enhance the success of your property
        portfolio? Founder Johannes Novacek comes from a background of design and project
        management within the construction industry. He has always had a passion to solve
        each and every puzzle that confronts him, no matter how big or small. Working through
        Sydneyâ€™s property boom, Johannes quickly noticed a massive inefficiency in the way
        property was being transacted and managed. Soon enough his desire to crack the way
        we view and navigate the real estate minefield was far too great and Johannes
        Property was developed."

      team have been able to analyze and build solutions that help investors achieve a higher
      value for their property. Having a dynamic hands-on approach, Johannes Property continues
